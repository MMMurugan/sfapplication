            <p>I am a huge fan of the lightning design system (SLDS) because it removes friction from the end user
                experience and offers outstanding guidance on how a component should behave and appear. The design
                system covers a huge variety of styling needs – paddings and margins and many more – without having to
                create any custom CSS of our own.</p>
